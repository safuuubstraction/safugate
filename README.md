## What is SafeGate Protocol ?

The SafeGate Protocol is a decentralized insurance protocol that allows users to secure their assets against smart contract risk. The protocol works by enabling users to stake a certain amount of tokens in exchange for coverage in a pool. 

Users can participate in self-staking pools where they can stake their own tokens or use sponsored pools where a third-party sponsor stakes the tokens on their behalf. 

Once a user has staked their tokens, they can submit a claim in the event of a smart contract failure, and if the claim is valid, they receive a payout from the pool. The protocol uses a decentralized governance system that enables the community to vote on which claims are valid and how much should be paid out. By using this system, the SafeGate Protocol is able to provide a transparent and decentralized insurance solution that is accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

## How do I use SafeGate Protocol ?

To use the SafeGate Protocol, you will first need to connect your digital wallet to a blockchain network that supports the protocol, such as Ethereum. Once you have a compatible wallet, you can follow these steps: 

1. Visit the SafeGate Protocol website and connect your wallet to the platform. 
2. Choose a pool to stake your tokens in. You can either participate in a self-staking pool or use a sponsored pool. 
3. Select the amount of tokens you want to stake and confirm the transaction. 

Once your tokens are staked, you can monitor your coverage and submit a claim if necessary. If a claim is valid, you will receive a payout from the pool.
